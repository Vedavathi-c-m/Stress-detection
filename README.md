This project presents an innovative system designed to detect and analyze stress levels in individuals by combining physiological signal monitoring and facial emotion recognition. The core objective is to develop a reliable, real-time, and non-intrusive solution that leverages embedded systems and machine learning to identify stress and provide timely alerts to concerned parties. As mental health becomes an increasingly critical concern in today’s fast-paced world, early detection of stress can contribute significantly to well-being and preventive care.
The system utilizes IoT-based hardware comprising sensors such as the heartbeat sensor (TCRT1000), sweat sensor (FC-37), and temperature sensor (DS18B20), all interfaced with an Arduino Uno microcontroller. These sensors continuously collect data such as heart rate, perspiration levels, and body temperature. Once collected, the data is evaluated against predefined threshold values. If these thresholds are exceeded, indicating a potential stress response, the system activates a buzzer and displays an alert on an LCD screen. Simultaneously, a camera captures the user’s facial image.
On the software front, OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, is employed to process the facial image. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is then used to analyze facial expressions and detect emotional states associated with stress, such as anger, sadness, or anxiety. If the system confirms a stress condition both physiologically and emotionally, it sends a notification via Telegram to a designated individual, such as a caregiver, family member, or supervisor, ensuring timely support and intervention.
The software stack includes Arduino IDE for embedded C programming and Python for the image processing and machine learning components. This dual-technology approach provides both real-time sensor data handling and advanced emotion classification capabilities.
Applications of this project span across various domains including real-time health monitoring systems, workplace wellness programs, and stress management tools for students, professionals, or individuals under high pressure. It holds particular promise in preventive healthcare, where early detection of stress could help mitigate long-term health complications.
Among its advantages, the system is cost-effective, scalable, and non-intrusive, combining both physical sensor data and visual cues to increase accuracy. It promotes awareness about mental health and facilitates early detection without the need for constant human supervision.
Looking ahead, the project can be enhanced by incorporating more sophisticated deep learning models for better accuracy, expanding the emotion dataset to include a broader range of facial expressions and stress indicators, and integrating a mobile application for remote monitoring and data visualization. The future roadmap also includes support for cloud-based analytics, enabling the creation of stress trend reports and predictive alerts, making this system an even more powerful tool for mental health management.
